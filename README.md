Assignment 2

*Thread*

What is a thread?
A thread is a single sequential flow of control within a program.

Threads allows a program to operate more efficiently by doing multiple things at the same time.
Threads can be used to perform complicated tasks in the background without interrupting the main program.
Every thread has a priority. Threads with higher priority are executed in preference to threads with lower priority.
