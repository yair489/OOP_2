Assignment 2

**Thread**

**What is a thread?**
A thread is a single sequential flow of control within a program.

Threads allows a program to operate more efficiently by doing multiple things at the same time.
Threads can be used to perform complicated tasks in the background without interrupting the main program.
Every thread has a priority. Threads with higher priority are executed in preference to threads with lower priority. 
Threads who have finished their jobs will die. It won't consume any more CPU time.

**ThreadPool**

**What is threadPool?**
A thread pool is a software design pattern for achieving concurrency of execution in a computer program.

A thread pool reuses previously created threads to execute current tasks and offers a solution to the problem of thread
cycle overhead and resource thrashing.
A thread pool manages a set of anonymous threads that perform work on request. The threads do not terminate right away.
When one of the threads completes a task, the thread becomes idle, ready to be dispatched to another task.
